Hello, wonderful student!
You've made it to the fourth year of your studies â€“ a big achievement! In this year, something exciting happens. All of students, who are studying Software Engineering, will be divided into different groups called "streams." These streams are like special paths that you can choose based on what you're interested in.

<b>Picking Your Stream: Your Choice Matters</b>
Here are the streams you can pick from:

1. <b>AI (Artificial Intelligence)</b>: 
    This is all about creating smart computers that can think and learn like humans.

2. <b>Software Engineering</b>: 
    This stream is for those who want to build cool software and apps that people use every day.

3. <b>Cyber Security</b>: 
    If you're interested in protecting computers and information from bad people on the internet, this is for you.

4. <b>IT (Information Technology)</b>: 
    This stream is about managing and making sure computers and technology work smoothly in businesses.

<b>Choosing Your Stream: How to Decide</b>
